# NeuralTrainer-NET

What is this? It's a fun experiment...If python can do it, I can do it too!

## Why?

Okay, I like to tinker. So, being bored one day I wondered: "Can I train my own model using C# with CUDA and have a somewhat functional mess?"<br/>
Appearently, the anwser to that is... kinda.

## Why C#?
Because it's my prefered language? Sometimes it is what it is.

<b>This project will lead nowhere, it shouldn't lead anywhere! It's a journey discovering what goes into building the tools needed for model training.</b>
